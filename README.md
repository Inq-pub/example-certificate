Inq.pub/certificate - Award certificate generator
=================================================
This is an intentionally simple [Inq.pub](https://inq.pub) award certificate generation example.

It takes two inputs - the name of the person on the certificate along with the certificate award title and outputs a compiled PDF document with those details.

If you specify optional email details it will be emailed to that address with the specified subject and body text.
